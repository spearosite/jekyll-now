When I first got interested in spearfishing and decided to finally buy some gear I was immediately overwhelmed by the information being thrown at me. Where do I even start? To make things even more difficult, most beginners guides did not include some of the gear I was going to need for the cold water. I wanted to make an in depth guide to help those of you who are just starting out and to get you spearing as soon as possible. Buying a whole set of gear is a daunting task, but when you know what to look for, it can be painless.

## Mask/Snorkel: [$20]

Let’s start with the mask first. It is far more important to find the correct mask compared to the snorkel because there is no one-size fits all option. Everyone has unique facial geometry making it essential to actually go in and try on multiple different masks. Since this is a beginners guide, we will just be looking at the fit. Okay, so you might be wondering how one goes about insuring a perfect fit. Well the two factors we are testing are the seal and comfort of the mask.

{: .box-note}
**Pro tip:** You should shave any facial hair that would be in between the mask and your skin.

First thing to do when fitting is to remove the straps of the mask. You can get any mask to seal to your face if you cinch the straps tight enough, but the headache that will ensue is NOT worth it. Place the front of the mask to your face and gently press it on while inhaling through your nose to create a light suction. Tilt your head around and contort your face. A proper fitting mask will stay on for this test.

Next thing to look out for is the comfort. If any part of the mask seems to be hitting you in a weird place or digging in, keep looking. The chaffing that can result from this is no fun at all. One thing to note is that the more flexible the silicon skirt is, the better seal you are going to get.
Since we are trying to get spearing on a budget, there is no need to get a free dive specific mask. Any mask that seals properly and is comfortable for you is great for now. An added bonus of getting a cheap mask is that they almost always come with a snorkel. We won’t be too picky when it comes to snorkels since they are not very expensive. If given a choice, go with the most simple [J-Style] snorkel. This is simply because the snorkels that come with the mask you will be buying are cheaply made and the added bits will just break. Let’s save ourselves the headache and go with the simple one.

These cheap masks are going to be what we call high-volume masks. This simply means that there is a larger volume of air between your face and the mask. Freediving specific masks are referred to as low-volume masks, and are much more expensive. The reason spearos prefer the low-volume masks is due to the fact that as you dive deeper, the mask compresses. Without equalizing the mask, you run the risk of getting “mask squeeze”.  This can result in broken blood vessels and a couple nice black eyes. Imagine a massive hickey across your face.  Not pretty! To equalize, you must exhale some air through your nose into the mask to combat the external pressure as you go deeper. Low-volume masks require less of your precious oxygen to equalize the mask. Thankfully this only really comes into play at depths below 30 or 40 feet.  For shallow diving there will be little to no benefit.


### Where to Buy a Freediving/Snorkelling Mask:

I recommend going to a sporting goods store over a dive shop for this because they will have much cheaper options. Remember, if you find multiple masks that fit, go for the cheapest one. Walmart and Target are also great places to check.

**Before you use your mask:** The lenses come out of the box with silicone residue/film that we must remove prior to the first use.If you don't,  the lenses will fog up so bad that you won’t be able to see anything. There are a few ways out there, but the easiest method is using toothpaste. The grit is enough to scrub the silicon, but not enough to scratch the lenses. This might take a few times to get it completely.

## Weights + Belt: [$20]

Weights are a necessary part of spearfishing. They allow you to reach the bottom with ease. The amount of weights you will use is dependent on how deep you plan on going and how buoyant you are with you suit on. The key is to weight your belt so you become neutrally buoyant at about 15 feet down. This allows you to float at the surface, but still be able to sink to the bottom after a few kicks. For spearfishing, a rubber belt with a quick release clasp is ideal. As you descend on your dive, the pressure will compress you, making the belt become loose. Because a rubber belt stretches, you can cinch it tighter, and as you compress it stays tight to your waist. The quick release is a safety precaution. If you are in trouble the first thing you do is take your weights off. In a time of panic, having to deal with a clasp is not a good idea.
